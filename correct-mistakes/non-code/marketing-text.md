Picnic is an offline supramarket that deliveries groceries to your home for free.
In the Picnic app you'll find all the products your used to from the supermarket, always at the best prices.
With us, food never lies around for long, but comes directly to your home from our farmers and bakers.
In addition, we do not have to throw away any food. Because when we receive the last order at 10 a.m., we know exactly how much breath we have to order from the bakker. In this way, we work together to protect the environment and keep prices high at the same time.
